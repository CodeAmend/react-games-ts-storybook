# React Games

I wanted to make a Lights Out game [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(game)), but decided to expand.

#### Original Goals
* Use typescript for the first time in a project
* Test the entire app properly
* use html instead of canvas to test performance
   * future goal of using canvas if performance is bad.
* Reuse the GridBoard for each game. So this is a architecture thing.
